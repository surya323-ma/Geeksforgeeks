Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, the task is to merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify a[] so that it contains the first n elements and modify b[] so that it contains the last m elements.


class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):        
        n = len(a)
        m = len(b)
        gap = (n + m + 1) // 2   
        while gap > 0:
            i = 0
            j = gap    
            while j < n + m:              
                # If both pointers are in the first array a[]
                if j < n and a[i] > a[j]:
                    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]                   
                # If first pointer is in a[] and 
                # the second pointer is in b[]
                elif i < n and j >= n and a[i] > b[j - n]:
                    a[i], b[j - n] = b[j - n], a[i]
                  # Both pointers are in the second array b
                elif i >= n and b[i - n] > b[j - n]:
                    b[i - n], b[j - n] = b[j - n], b[i - n]
                i += 1
                j += 1
            # After operating for gap of 1 break the loop
            if gap == 1:
                break    
            # Calculate the next gap
            gap = (gap + 1) // 2

Approach:
This function efficiently merges two sorted arrays without using extra space, following the Shell Sort Gap Method to minimize swaps.
- Calculate Initial Gap: The gap is initially set to (n + m + 1) // 2, which helps in gradually reducing the distance between elements being compared.
- Iterative Comparison:
- Case 1: If both pointers (i and j) lie within the first array a[], swap elements if needed.
- Case 2: If i is in a[] and j is in b[], swap if a[i] > b[j-n].
- Case 3: If both pointers are within b[], swap elements if needed.
- Update Gap: After each iteration, the gap shrinks using gap = (gap + 1) // 2. The process continues until gap == 1, ensuring a fully sorted array.
Time Complexity:
- The gap reduction approach ensures efficient comparisons.
- Sorting via shell sort gap method takes approximately O((n+m) log(n+m)), better than naive merging.
