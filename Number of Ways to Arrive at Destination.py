You are given an undirected weighted graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where edges[i] = [ui, vi, timei] means that there is an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi that takes timei minutes to reach.
Your task is to return in how many ways you can travel from node 0 to node V - 1 in the shortest amount of time.
